Effective Date: April 16, 2020

AnswerBot. (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates the [https://answerbot.app](https://answerbot.app) website, AnswerBot widget and Slack application (collectively the “Services”). This page informs you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information which personally identifies you (“Personal Information”) when you use our Services. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”). We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Services. By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


### Information Collection and Use; Personal Information

We may ask you to provide us, or third parties may provide us, with certain Personal Information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, postal address, email address, and employer. We collect Personal Information for the purpose of providing the Services, identifying and communicating with you about the Services, responding to your requests/inquiries, servicing your purchase orders, improving our Services, and communicating with you about our Services, discounts, and promotions.


### How Long We Keep Your Personal Information

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

_Account Information_

We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, it will be anonymized and used to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.

If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by your employer under our agreement with your employer as required by the administrator of your account. If your account is deactivated, your information and conversations you may have had and actions you may have taken on the Services will remain in order to allow your team members to make full use of the Services.
